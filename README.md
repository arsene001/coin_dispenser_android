"# coin_dispenser_android"

This is built with Android.

To test the application, I connected my device to the laptop and run the application straight into the phone.

There is a java file ServerHandler.java where the ip address can be changed. Please obtain your ip address and replace accordingly

Then rebuild the all project.

All works well when the phone and laptop running java back end/android projects are connected to the same network.
